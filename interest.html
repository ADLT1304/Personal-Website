                <h2>Making Stuff</h2>
                <p>I like to fix and create things, not just on my computer and drawing I like to physically make things, I'm learning how to solder so I can make a robot or a drone.
                I'm very far away from making anything even close but it does interest me alot and I hope to get into it more in the future. Of course thats not it
                I also enjoy making basic things that don't require alot of technology like tiny everyday use things such as cupholders, coasters thats mainly it but 
                thats because I'm really limited to my resources and I hope to expand from just 2 things to almost anything.</p>

                <h2>Airplanes</h2>
                <p>When I lived in California I used to see alot of airplanes and helicopters flying by and I remember just looking up and thinking about how cool they were
                and asking myself what it felt like to be in there, it helped me get over my fear of heights.
                I wanted to join the air force when I was in freshmen year of highschool and even started training until I realized I didn't 
                meet the requirements because I have poor eyesight and its a major requierment for the airforce to have 20/20 eyesight and you have to pass a depth 
                perception test. I was sad for like a year until I realized I'm decent with computers and got into computer science.</p>

                <h2>Computers</h2>
                <p>Computers always drew my attention, I built my first one when I was 10 which is late but still impressive because I'm from the country side of California
                just a bike ride away from the border, and growing up there was not alot of computers, my first encounter was a laptop and I didn't even have WIFI, I had
                a hot spot type of thing that you would have to connect to the laptop. Life was hard I had to wait 5 minutes for anything to load. It was worth the wait because it gave me just a tiny array that there was alot more to the world than just a little town in California. 
                Computers interest me thats why I got into coding. I want to work somewhere where computers are necessary because I love people and I think
                computers help people connect around the world like nothing else.</p>
