                <h2>Excercise/Fitness</h2>
                <p>Basketball is my favorite sport I love playing and blocking or stealing the ball not so much scoring unless
                I'm in the paint. Boxing is really fun I like to hit and get hit, it really helps me calm down and I just have a love for the sport.  
                I like to excercise and stay fit by going to the gym it makes life easier in my case. Jump roping is one of my favorite activities because I have heavy feet 
                which makes boxing harder and wrestling alot easier, but I just love boxing so much that if I wanted to get better I needed to find my rhythm and
                get light on my feet I would have to figure out how to jump some rope.</p>

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>I play a decent amount of video games I try to stay away from them but they're too fun. CS:GO is a first person shooter, it's one of my favorites because I like to talk trash sometimes and its one of the few games that still lets you but it can get alittle too toxic. 
                    DayZ's a survival game that lot of people hate, but its one of my favorites because it's really detailed and I love how mechanical it is, it can be difficult
                    but thats why its so good, the gun fights are also really fun. Age of Empires 4 is a real time strategy game, it's like real time chess except you have to build your army from 
                    scratch and have villagers getting resources so you can rebuild or a mass your army, anyways you have to make your opponent forfeit or destroy all their
                    landmarks in which case you'll win. League of Legends is a MOBA game it's kind of a hard game it took me a while to be worse than decent, I can't talk 
                    trash in this game because I'm bad and also could get banned but I still like it for some reason.</p>

                <h2>TV/Movies</h2>
                <p>Endgame was not even half as good as Infinity War, I don't care how much money it made. If I was a murderer on deathrow who was fortunate enough to get a 
                last meal you bet your top dollar it's gonna be almost everything on the Popeye's menu and I'm going to watch Infinity War. That being said Infinity War is a
                great movie with a sad ending leaving you with the question "How will they fix this?". The Ultimate Fighter is a reality TV series that originally aired on 
                Spike, but you can find it on Hulu with ESPN+. There;s 2 professional MMA fighters that fight for the UFC. They are the team captains, 
                and they pick from 16 fighters, pick who fights who, and those 16 fighters train and compete to see who's the ultimate fighter. 
                Only one can win. </p>
